		<a href="index.html">Visual Depictions of World War II</a> is intended to give viewers an abundant collection of visual media that spans the entirety of the war and covers the majority of vital events. To that end, we've scoured several lists of WW2 adaptations and used them to compile a collection that is comprehensive enough to include not only timeless classics, but also foreign and lesser known productions. While this list is by no means complete (hundreds of productions are still absent), we hope this can, at the very least, give you a great starting off point for enjoying productions of and learning more about the single most deadly war in the history of humankind.
